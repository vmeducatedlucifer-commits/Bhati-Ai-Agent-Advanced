# Live Playwright Browser Automation

Rawal AI now includes a per-thread Playwright Chromium session. The Browser tab can start a live headless Chromium instance and connect to a bidirectional WebSocket stream that sends compact JPEG viewport frames approximately four times per second. The same channel accepts navigation, mouse, typing, keyboard, and scroll commands; if the stream cannot connect, the UI falls back to authenticated screenshot requests. Agent runs can use the same session through the `browser_*` tools.

## Runtime setup

Install the pinned Python dependency and Chromium runtime:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```

The Docker sandbox image installs Playwright and Chromium with system dependencies during image build:

```bash
docker build -f sandbox/Dockerfile -t rawal-ai-agent-sandbox:latest sandbox
```

Playwright's official Docker guidance recommends pinning the Playwright image/dependency version, using `--init`, and allocating sufficient shared memory for Chromium. The supplied sandbox image installs the browser runtime, while the application keeps the browser session isolated per thread and closes all sessions during application shutdown.

## Agent tools

| Tool | Purpose | Permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_navigate` | Open an HTTP(S) URL | Safe |
| `browser_screenshot` | Capture the viewport or full page | Safe |
| `browser_inspect` | Read visible text, links, and form controls | Safe |
| `browser_click` | Click a CSS selector | Write |
| `browser_type` | Fill or type into a CSS selector | Write |
| `browser_press` | Press a key or shortcut | Write |
| `browser_mouse` | Move/click at viewport coordinates | Write |
| `browser_scroll` | Scroll the page | Write |

The existing thread permission mode controls agent-initiated write actions. Direct actions from the Browser tab are explicit user actions and use the same authenticated thread session.

## Autonomous planning and recovery

When browser tools are available, the agent receives a browser-specific execution protocol. It plans briefly, inspects the current page before selecting a target, verifies the state after meaningful actions, and avoids repeating an identical failed action. The runner also performs an automatic post-action browser checkpoint and injects the current URL, title, and visible text back into the next model turn. Checkpoints are bounded to three recovery attempts per run; after that limit the agent reports the blocker instead of burning the full step budget on a loop. `browser_recovery` events make these checkpoints visible in the activity stream.

## Isolation and safety

Each thread receives its own Playwright `BrowserContext`, viewport, cookies, storage, and page. Browser sessions are not shared between threads. Navigation is limited to HTTP(S) URLs. The browser is headless by default; the UI receives screenshots rather than a remote desktop stream. Screenshots are returned as in-memory base64 PNG payloads and are not written to the project workspace unless a future artifact workflow explicitly requests persistence.

The browser is intended for user-authorized work. It should not be used to bypass authentication, CAPTCHAs, access controls, or website terms. Production deployments should run the backend and Chromium with a non-root user and an appropriate container seccomp profile. The local development fallback may run Chromium with the host's available sandbox configuration.
